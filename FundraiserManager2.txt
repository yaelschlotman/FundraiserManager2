When I looked up something on the Internet:

2/22:  Looked up again how to read/write to text. 
		Wrote up classes for file reader and file writer, 
		but I still don't understand it, really.

2/23:  Spent half an hour looking up and understanding "persistant data".
		 

2/25:  Looked up how to convert string to int and decimal.

2/29:  Spent all morning looking up working through writing to and reading from a text file.
